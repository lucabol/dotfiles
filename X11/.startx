#xfce4-session spits out quite a bit of text during logout, which I guess
#confuses x2go so we would get a black screen and session hang.
#adding redirect to a logfile like "~/logfile" or "/dev/null" nicely solved it
# see http://bugs.x2go.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=914

# Also this is useful to merge resources before initialization

xrdb -merge $HOME/.Xresources
urxvtd -o -q -f
