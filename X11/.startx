#xfce4-session spits out quite a bit of text during logout, which I guess
#confuses x2go so we would get a black screen and session hang.
#adding redirect to a logfile like "~/logfile" or "/dev/null" nicely solved it
# see http://bugs.x2go.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=914

# right alt is ctrl and caps lock is escape
setxkbmap -option ctrl:ralt_rctrl -option caps:escape

# Also this is useful to merge resources before initialization
xrdb -merge $HOME/.Xresources

# start the urxvtd daemon
urxvtd -o -q -f

# create appropriate config
cat /home/lucabol/.i3config.local /home/lucabol/dotfiles/i3/config.base > /home/lucabol/.config/i3/config

# avoid output confusion
/usr/bin/i3 > /dev/null
